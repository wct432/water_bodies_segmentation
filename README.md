# water_body_segmentation
In this project we will be performing image segmentation to segment bodies of water in satellite images.We will load our jpeg images as tensors in a Tensorflow dataset which will be fed to our model. We will do this using a Tensorflow Convolutional Neural Network based on the U-Net architecture.
